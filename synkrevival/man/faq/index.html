            <br>
            Jamiroquai's singles are generally released first in Britain and then additional versions are sometimes released in the United States and/or Japan and/or Australia. Commonly, the UK release of a single is on two separate CD's and Europe initially gets a two or three track version of the single. The United States often gets a release shortly afterwards.

            <b><font size="2">Which tracks have had remixes made of them?</font></b><br>
            <br>
            Many of the single releases over the years have included remixes by many of the worlds top remixers. Here is an overview of some of the tracks that have been mixed by the maestros.<br>
            <br>
            The first ever Jamiroquai release, "When You Gonna Learn?", had Marc Nelson and Demus of the Young Disciples behind the J.K. Mix of the single.<br>
            <br>
            David Morales is the man behind the Classic Club mix of "Space Cowboy" which was a worldwide club success. He was one of the first DJ's in New York to play house music around the mid 1980's. In his career he has gained world fame for his remixing talents with artists such as U2 and Mariah Carey. The mix first appeared on the US single release of the "Space Cowboy" single and then on the UK release of "Stillness In Time" during the first half of 1995. On 1 September 1996, the remix was voted number one in the Kiss 100 FM London all time listeners top 100 countdown. More recently, David remixed "Cosmic Girl".<br>
            <br>
            Todd Terry started DJ'ing during the Hip Hop era and then moved into the world of making house music. On the Jamiroquai front, he remixed "Alright" in 1997.<br><br>
            Louis Vega and Kenny Gonzalez of Masters At Work remixed the "Emergency On Planet Earth" single. Vega started mixing in the 1970's and after meeting Gonzalez through mutual friend David Morales, started collaborating on both  remixing and their own music. Lately, they are known as the men behind Nuyorican Soul.<br><br>
            The most ambitious Jamiroquai remixes to date are the D&C; mixes of Alright, by Dave Navarro and Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This remix surfaced mid 1997 on the US promo of the same single and has a catchy "rock" feel to the tune.<br><br>
            With the success of the in-house DJ D-Zire remix of "Alright", the band have hinted during interviews that they wish to do more and more remixesthemselves.<br><br>
            Apart from the band members and production staff who have mixed tracks, the following is a summary of who has remixed what:<br>

            <b><font size="2">How in the world did they make the "Virtual Insanity"
            video?!? Is the floor moving or are the walls moving?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
            <b>Has Jay really got magnets in his Adidas?</b></font><br>
            <br>
            Imagine a room constructed with only three walls and a ceiling, kind of like a giant box. On the fourth open wall of the room, there's a camera locked into place.<br>
            <br>
            The walls are on wheels so that the room can be moved around as a whole. The camera never moves in relation to the room; the three walls and ceiling always look the same even though the room is being moved backwards and forwards, to the left, to the right, and sometimes around in a circle.   Sometimes, for added effect, the couches are attached to the walls and move with the rest of the room. Sometimes one (or both) of the couches are not attached to the walls so that when the whole room is moved, it looks instead like they are moving toward or away from Jay, when they are in fact remaining stationary.   Jay always positions himself so that he's more-or-less facing the camera and skillfully maneuvers himself inside the moving room to maintain the mesmerizing funhouse effect of the video. Sometimes he moves with the movement of the room so that it looks like he's having to run to stay in place and other times he remains stationary so it looks like he's gliding across the floor and the walls are closing in on him. He "dances" with the couches to look as if he's controlling their movement or being chased by them.   Jonathan Glazer, who won several awards for directing the video (see above for more information), describes the process thusly: "No computer trickery was used. What we did was put the whole set on wheels and attach the camera to one wall. The furniture also had little wheels, and we had guys moving the set and the furniture [outside of the frame].<br>
            The floor never moved. It was like a magician's trick."<br>
            <br>
            <br>Jay himself says of the video, "I don't rehearse the movements. I mean there are certain places that I have to be at a certain point in the filming, what line I had to stop on to make it work. But it just clicks and when I watch it back I know it's worked."<br>
            <br>
            Contrary to popular belief, as Glazer says, the floor is not moving. Nor is Jay wearing magnets on his shoes, despite the announcement in the fall of '96 on the now-defunct J's Joint. After all, how would Jay achieve his signature  moves? But, what if Adidas did manufacture magnet-soled sneakers...<br>
            <br>

            <b><font size="2">I keep hearing about a "hidden" track on Travelling
            Without Moving but I can't find it - HELP!</font></b><br>
            <br>
            Different versions of Travelling Without Moving have different bonus (or "hidden") tracks. Some versions have just the regular tracks-- as listed on the sleeve. There is one limited printing that includes both the tracks "Do U Know Where You're Coming From" and "Funktion." The regular US release only contains "Do U Know." The regular UK release only contains "Funktion."<br>
            <br>
            Of the "hidden" track "Funktion" Jay says, "It was done in one take...just for a laugh. We didn't want to list it because it was just us playing after we had set the studio up to do another tune. But it's a bit o' fun, ain't it?"<br>
            <br>

            <b><font size="2">Have any of the members of Jamiroquai ever collaborated
            with anyone else?</font></b><br>
            <br>
            In '92, just before joining up with Jamiroquai, Wallis Buchanan played his yidaki on Galliano's A Joyful Noise Unto the Creator on the tracks "Grounation" and "Skunk Funk" (released by Talkin' Loud).<br>
            <br>
            In '95 members of Jamiroquai appeared on Guru's Jazzmatazz Volume 2 The New Reality on the ninth track called "Lost Souls." Jay Kay provides vocals backing Guru's rapping. In addition, Stuart Zender plays bass, Wallis Buchanan plays didgeridoo, and DJ D-Zire provides the scratches on the track.<br>
            <br>
            More famously, during early '96 Jay recorded a demo vocal for a track for a friend entitled "Do U Know Where You're Coming From." To his horror, Jay heard it played on London's Kiss FM and after a great deal of persuasion, went back into the studio and recorded the track properly with jungle artist M-Beat. Toby Smith also came in to help write music with M-Beat and played keyboards on the track. Derrick McKenzie also joined up and played the drums on the track. The resulting single turned out to be a success for Jamiroquai as it reached a peak of number 12 in the UK singles chart during June '96. In addition to the single release (released by M-Beat featuring Jamiroquai), this track can be found on some versions of the Travelling Without Moving album.<br>
            <br>
            In February '97, Jamiroquai teamed up with Diana Ross at the UK Brit Awards to perform a duet of her 1980 hit "Upside Down." The Brit Awards is the UK popular music equivalent of the US Grammy Awards and publicity of the event was great in that even the Reuters newswire reported the duet, saying "Pop's generation gap was bridged by Diana Ross who performed her classic "Upside Down" with soul band Jamiroquai." The whole band were there performing, and looking extremely smart in their suits! For photographs of the event and RealAudio downloads, please follow this link.
            <br>
            More recently, in 2000, Jay performed vocals on the cover track "I'm in the mood for love", included on the soundtrack to the film "Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large."<br>
            <br>

            recordings I should know about?</font></b><br>
