<br>
In February 1997, at the BRITs, Jamiroquai were nominated in two categories, "Best British Video" (for "Virtual Insanity," of course) and "Best Dance Act." Once more, Jamiroquai did not win in either category.<br>
<br>
Later in the year, Jamiroquai would make up for the disappointment at the BRITs and go on to win a whole slew of awards for the "Virtual Insanity" video.<br>
<br>
In April 1997, at the Music Week Creative And Design Awards "Virtual Insanity" won awards for "Best Pop Video" as well awards for "Best Cinematography" and "Best Special Effects."<br>
<br>
Also in April 1997, at the 2nd annual PIM Italian Music Awards, Jamiroquai won the award for "Best Dance Artist."<br>
<br>
In May 1997, at the Music Video Production Association Awards in Los Angeles, "Virtual Insanity was awarded "Video of the Year."<br>
<br>
In their most high profile win, at the 14th annual MTV Video Music Awards in September 1997, Jamiroquai were again the most nominated act, gathering ten nominations for their video for "Virtual Insanity." Jamiroquai walked away with four awards, including "Breakthrough Video" and the coveted "Best Video of the Year." (The other two awards were in technical categories: "Best Special Effects" and and "Best Cinematography.")<br>
<br>
Also in September 1997, Brazilian viewers of the program TV Zero voted "Virtual Insanity" the "Best International Group Video."<br>
<br>
In November 1997 Travelling Without Moving won the the Best Album of the Year at the Music Of Black Origin (MOBO) Awards, held in London.<br>
<br>
Another large US success came in February 1998 when "Virtual Insanity" won a Grammy for "Best Pop Performance for a Duo or Group".<br>
<br>
In February 1999 Jamiroquai were nominated for two BRIT awards for "Best Video" (for "Deeper Underground") and "Best Dance Act".  Once again the band failed to win.<br>
<br>
On a lighter note, at the "Elle Style Awards" in Autumn 1998, Jay Kay won the award for "Best Dressed Popster."<br>
