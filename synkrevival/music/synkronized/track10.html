There's no way<br>
I'm coming back to you<br>
I've just got to say<br>
That everything we did is through<br>
You tried to undermine<br>
The better ranges of my nature<br>
But soon your going to find<br>
You should have started talking straighter<br>
<br><br>
Now don't you worry<br>
I won't put you down<br>
I'm in no hurry, baby<br>
To see you go to ground<br>
Because it's true what they say<br>
You know it's true what they say<br>
Your only king for a day<br>
I guess your happy that way<br>
<br><br>
Well there's no hope<br>
For peace and reconciliation<br>
You're quick to play your hand<br>
But what you haven't learnt is patience<br>
So look before you leap<br>
To tell the world your coloured story<br>
It's clear your talk is cheap<br>
You'd do anything to get your glory<br>
<br><br>
So spread your wings and fly<br>
There is no doubt<br>
You're so sorry inside you've got something to shout about<br>
Because it's true what they say<br>
You know it's true what they say<br>
You're only king for a day<br>
I guess you're happy that way<br>
<br><br>
And there's no love<br>
Ever to be lost between us<br>
I guess this is because<br>
The damage that you've done is so grievous<br>
So I hang my head<br>
To dwell on what might have been<br>
But what you left instead<br>
Is pieces of a broken dream<br>
<br><br>
Now don't you worry<br>
I won't put you down<br>
I'm in no hurry<br>
To see you go to ground<br>
Because it's true what they say<br>
You know it's true what they say<br>
You're only king for a day<br>
I guess you're happy that way<br>
<br><br>
So spread your wings and fly<br>
There is no doubt<br>
You're so sorry inside you've<br>
Got something to shout about<br>
<br><br>
Because it's true what they say<br>
You know it's true what they say<br>
Your only king for a day<br>
I guess you're happy that way<br>
<br><br>
Don't you see that, you're only king for a day<br>
You must believe that<br>
