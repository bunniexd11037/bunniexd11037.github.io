Will it change you inside out<br>
And then it flows<br>
To the places unfamiliar yeah<br>
<br>
Let me tell, I'm not for you<br>
You're so hot for me<br>
So get on girl<br>
Come on (x4)<br>
I'm hot for you<br>
So get on<br>
I want to get it on with you<br>
I'm sending<br>
I hope you got the sense to read between the lines<br>
You know that in the book it says that<br>
For me you never seem to find the time<br>
Come on I've waited for your phonecalls<br>
But you must be uptown having fun<br>
When you do that thing you do<br>
I get so exited too<br>
But you never think to ask me if I want to come with you<br>
<br><br>
So honey, where do we go from here?<br>
You know baby...<br>
I've been trying to find out but I'm still some way from knowing<br>
Come on, you know I am<br>
It's not exactly clear, no no<br>
The love you should be giving me<br>
Is the love you're rarely showing<br>
That's the way love goes<br>
That's the way<br>
That's the way it goes for me and you<br>
Come on let me tell you now<br>
<br><br>
I feel you're pushing me out<br>
Soon I'm gonna lose my patience girl<br>
Can't understand what you're about<br>
Cause there's no communication<br>
You say you love to love me, love to love me<br>
But you always keep your distance<br>
So honey strike me off your list<br>
If your love comes with a twist<br>
Cause I want the part that lingered on my lips when we first kissed<br>
<br><br>
Say do you love me<br>
If you do tell me something<br>
And make it true<br>
Do you love me<br>
I need to know<br>
Baby can't you tell me where we're gonna go<br>
<br><br>
Where do we go from here?<br>
I've been trying to find out but I'm still some way from knowing<br>
It's not exactly clear no no<br>
The love you should be giving me<br>
Is the love you're rarely showing<br>
That's the, That's the way love goes<br>
And where it's taking us well we don't know<br>
So lets move straight on ahead<br>
And tow in the line between us girl<br>
I think I'd sooner make this love dead<br>
Than waste all my time on you, yeah<br>
I'm wasting all my time<br>
I'm gonna learn learn learn<br>
That's the way love goes<br>
That's the way<br>
It's gonna hurt me so bad<br>
But I won't let it show<br>
I get the feeling that it's gonna<br>
Tear out my mind till I can no longer breath<br>
I know I'm gonna love, love (?)<br>
That's the way love goes<br>
<br><br>
INSTRUMENTAL BREAK
<br><br>
Where do we go from here?<br>
I've been trying to find out but I'm still some way from knowing<br>
It's not exactly clear<br>
The love you should be giving me<br>
Is the love you're rarely showing<br>
Hey but that's the way love goes now<br>
You know that's the way love goes<br>
<br>
I'm so hot for you (x3)</font>
