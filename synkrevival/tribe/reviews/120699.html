 Deeper Underground got everyones pulse racing, and the atmosphere was wild.

 Respect to Jay for his Milosevic comment. That Denise is one lucky lady to have bagged such a groovy moover.

 They just never fail to deliver- till next time, keep those tunes coming.<br><br></td>

Jay boogied the night away, so much that he collapsed on the stage!Well at least he moves- unlike Boyzone~Jay joked.
<br>
Wallis is so fab on the didje, the atmosphere was electric, especially when then did Deeper Underground,- Jay got down on his knees in front of Toby on the keyboard, worshipping all the vibes that were shaking the arena. We are the number 1 Jamiroquai fans, we cant wait until Jamiroquai come back to Birmingham, as you are the funkiest, talented LIVE band around on our Planet Home, we love you!!!!!!!!!!<br><br></td>

A woman who i was dancing with offerd jay a joint, it set it to the back of the stage. J made jokes all the time, and when 1 lad said that his mrs was gourges he remaked that he should keep reading those magazines, and said that she was at the back of the arena, the whole croud looked to the back!
<br>
The band where so close to us, i could hear jay speaking when he ducked away from the mike, how cool is that, the dj before hand was good, but evey one was to anxious to see the best band in the world, he went on for to long, and eventually got booed off stage.
<br>
The whole concert was the highlight, but when J balanced on top of the speakers, and jumped down to the ground it was so cool, as he ran past and touched my hand. he is the man!
<br>
The concert started with hightimes, all you could hear was the bass, then the curtains droped as the song started, and there they were, JAMIROQUAI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<br>
at the end of the concert they went behind the set, the cround couldt stop screeming, they came back out, the cround went mad, the disco balls came on, and canned heat was played, if you get the chance, GO.<br><br></td>

And it worked we were only two guys and weve seen all the band. The concert was amaising unfortunatly i was at the back of the stage (seats) but the big screens helped us to see Jay, Wallis dancing all around. We keeped dancing all the show long and it was really canned heat. Thanks lads keep rolling, one of the best moment in my life, see you in Metz (1/10/99).<br><br></td>
