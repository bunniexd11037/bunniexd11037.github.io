The music sounded so good live, I just wish I could have heard more.  Jay Kay said that they were out of cheeba and asked if anyone could help him out, so I threw a big phatty up on the stage and he got it!!!  It was the only thing I had to share, but it made me feel good knowing that the boys got a buzz on behalf of my kindness.  I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE BUZZ, JASON KAY!!!!  THE MIDWEST BROTHERS AND SISTERS REALLY LOVE YOU!!!!  K E E P O N S M O K I N, my brother.   PLUR    <br><br></td>

<br>
I cant believe I went to this amazing concert...
<br>
I came all the way from Monterrey, Mexico to see Jamiroquai!
<br>
Ever since I heard their music, I fell for it, and fell for Jay too =) 
<br>
their music just fills my soul in a way that none other music can do it, When they sarted playing Return of the Space Cowboy, oh God! a tear came out..
<br>
It just gets me! And all the other songs were just great, more than perfect... I went to the concert with my mom and 8-year-old sis, they loved it too!!
<br>
hope Jamiroquai comes and visit us here in Monterrey, Hugs and keep up the good vibes! Love you Jay!<br><br></td>

<br>
I come from Europe, so I was kind of concerned because not many people here heard about Jamiroquai, but when I saw the audience at Riviera, I was glad I was in Chicago. They know what good music is.
<br>
For me this concert was a dream come true, because I allways wanted to see Jay live, but I was afraid he wont sound as good as on CDs, but, hey, it was 10 times better.
<br>
I hope in November they will play Falling, and that the audience will know the new CD better. My birthday is in November, and what better gift could I give to myself but beeing at the concert.
<br>
I think Supersonic was unbelievable, Black Capricorn Day makes you regret youre not a Capricorn, Canned Heat was      given to us as a reward, at the end. But I cant say which one I liked best, because I like all the songs, old or new.
<br>
Thank you Chicagoans for beeing such a great crowd. For a moment I felt like home.
<br>
See you all in November!!!
<br>
Thanks, Jay!

		<td valign="TOP" colspan="3"><font face="AG Book Rounded Bold, Helvetica, Arial" size="2" color="#999999"> What can I say? The concert was worderful, and Im glad that I had a chance to attend a live concert of theirs!
<br>
 I went with my friend and my dad, I was telling them that we should arrive there at 5:00 because it would be busy..... but, my dad didnt want to wait in line that long, so we arrived there at 6:00. Boy, were they suprised to see all the people standing in line!
<br>
 When we arrived, the line was wrapped around the corner, so I was feeling kind of blue, but we did arrive just in time, because even more people came. We stood by the alley of the Riveria, and Wallice walked by us, and standing to the left of us on the street, was Simon. 
<br>
 Ok, so when we walked through the doors, I was so excited and nervous that I was shaking! 
<br>
 We went into the room where the concert was being held, I saw that there were alot of empty places in the front to stand. So I grabbed her arm and ran over there just in time! 
<br>
 There were two people in front of me, and they were taller, but I could still see the stage...oh, yeah! We were about two feet away from the speakers on the right side of the audience. So we could hear everything very well!
<br>
 After waiting forever what seemed like forever (45 minutes) they opened with High Times.  Let me tell you, it was all just fantastic! Everybody in the audience singing every word with Jay, it was beautiful!! Of course he was sweating from the dancing and singing and you could tell on his shirt, so he joked, And the prize for the wet t-shirt contest goes to.... 
<br>
 About half-way through the performance, Jay spoke about the crisis in Kosovo, so they dedicated Too Young To Die to the victims. You could tell that some of the fans didnt know the song... only about half of the audience was singing along. But was very pretty.
<br>
The played Supersonic and Wallis on his didjeridoo was perfect! Since that was the only song he did, he  danced around the stage to get the atmosphere in the audience even more exciting! He waved and smiled to people; he waved to me one time, so I waved back, and a little bit later I flashed him the peace sign, so he smiled and gave the peace sign back at me!
<br>
I cant exactly remember (I was just too happy at the time!) but I think the last song was Depper Underground  When that was finished, Jay told us about how much he loved Chicago,and they are flattered by all the support over the years. Then he said that they would be back in November! (Im already begging my dad to take me again!!) Of course, they did an encore, and they played Canned Heat with everybody singing along and boogie-ing down to the end of the perfect night.<br><br></td>

		<td valign="TOP" colspan="3"><font face="AG Book Rounded Bold, Helvetica, Arial" size="2" color="#999999">Last night was truly an amazing Jamiroquai concert. Chicago gave it up for the next Rolling Stones (35+ years) that will mesmerize world through its music.
<br>

<br>
For us lucky supporters that arrived at the Riv before 5:30 p.m., we were fortunate enough to see JK walking down the street with no bodyguard. He talked to us as if we were his buddies, signed everything people gave him; concert tickets, CDs, CD sleeves, pieces of paper, t-shirts, buffalo man posters people ripped off the street poles, and was posing like crazy for the people that had their cameras.
<br>

<br>
Jasons aura is so calming and uplifting. Hes just as normal as we who are not in the entertainment industry.
<br>

<br>
When the concert started, the sold out arena of 1500+ people went crazy. JK even acknowledge Chicago as his favorite place to play because we give it up. As the first notes of High Times kicked off Jamiroquais show in Chicago after a two and a half year absence, the audience sang every single word.
<br>

<br>
I, having the honor of being in the front hanging on the rail, could hear the audience singing and see the amazement on the bands faces as we partied with them. JK could have put the mic down and we would have sang all night for him.
<br>

<br>
After an amazing rendition of Cosmic Girl people were screaming and thats when JK came over to me and I jumped on the rail to tell him to play Falling he grabbed my hand so I wouldnt fall and he could hear what I was saying. His response, We didnt rehearse that one. I thought it was the funniest thing because I was expecting the Wembley song list. But, he led the band into another hit song, Planet Home.
<br>

<br>
The concert was all dance. It was funk and jazz together. The horn section was too funky! JKs dance moves were smooth as well as Wallis whos Didgeridoo performance on Supersonic nearly brought the house down. That should most definitely be the next release after Black Capicorn Day. And speaking of BCD, my favorite song on the new release, the audience almost went into cardiac arrest. 
<br>

<br>
For those of you who saw the webcast, it was better if you were at the Riviera. For those of you who will see Jamiroqaui soon, youre in for the time of your lives. Im still singing and smiling. JK did say, they will be back in Chicago in November. Im there.
<br>

<br>
Remember, they may need some wings to get to the next gig so bring extra gifts you who partake in the natural foods of the earth.
<br>

<br>
Universal Peace, Love and Happiness
<br>
... take care of Planet Home...

I have seen the band live three times, and this rates as one of the best shows I have seen in my life! Period!! From beginning to end the band rocked as if there was no tomorrow. And if that were true, I would have died a happy man. With a Becks in one hand and a tightly rolled blunt in the other, I was ready for whatever they had up their sleeves.From long time favorites like Too Young To Die and Light Years to new shit like PLanet Home and Soul Education, the band never tired only got better. As the thick smoke permeated the Riviera, those lucky enough to cop tickets witnessed one of the best live shows one could imagine. Thumbs up! Way Up!! See ya at the next show!<br><br></td>
