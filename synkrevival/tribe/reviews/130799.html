We finally did and once we got patted down by the security guards, my friend and I who is from England ran at a full sprint to be in the front row and lean on the stage.  Jamiroquai came on late, and sadly ended early but the boys through down the tightest set Ive ever heard.  Things were pretty chill until JK asked if anyone saw the movie Godzilla.  We all laughed and screamed back that it was the worst movie that weve ever seen.  Jay said, I didnt ask if you liked it, I just wanted to know if you seen it. So at that moment they dropped the dankist version of deeper underground that quite possible has ever been played.  The State exploded and has left Detroit drooling for another taste of JAMIROQUAI.

I have to tell ya, that was one of the biggest bummers Ive ever had!  Two years ago I had tickets for their concert in Detroit- but it was cancelled.  I was crushed.  So this time, me and all my gang got there at 6 with our kick-ass floor tickets.  We were by far the youngest people there (Were 16 now, but were 15) so it made it all the cooler.  When the band finally came onstage, the whole group was packed on the floor.  Ive never felt so close to strangers.  All united to hear this band who were so incredible.  I met lots of random people and danced and sang for the whole time.  Thanks so much, jay and and all the others, for making the best concert of my life so incredible, that I remember every second 8 months later.  PLEASE COME BACK!!! <br><br></td>

The set was sweet, though I tried to get people around me to start chanting E-O-P-E!! with me, with no luck. They did play Light Yearsthough, my favorite song(Thanks guys!). I still would have had a good time even if they didnt, It just made the night that more special. Two things I wish for next U.S. tour are- A,They will let me give Jay a bottle of Extacy(Gatorade)and B, Nick will be familiar with the bass parts on Mr. Moon. I felt happy for the young woman Jay picked out of the crowd to dance with him during Miss You. Oh, by the way- If any funk-brothers or sisters would like to chat on icq or something with a fellow jamiroquai fan, e-mail me at jk_funk@usa.net<br><br></td>

I had to see them perform, so me and five of my best friends did the next best thing -go to Detroit! The concert was fulfilling and the involvement left me drained! It was over too fast. These guys are so fantastic, I dont think that I would be satisfied with any length of time. Hope to see you guys soon!!!! <br><br></td>

I dont think anyone had a bad spot in the jam packed sold out house and as, result everyone had a good time.

Jay and the entire band had it going on last night. The stage set up was very cool, and when Jay broke into classics such as Alright, Cosmic Girl, Return of the Space Cowboy,and High Times the crowd went crazy. This is my first time at a Jamiroquai concert, but it certainly wont be my last. I also loved the way that Jay and the band hung around after the show to sign autographs and just chill with his fans I thouhght that was so awesome. After last night, the coolest band in the world has risen to a higher level in my eyes. See you in November Jay.  <br><br></td>

I do have a bone to pick, though. I drove all the way from Cleveland to see the show (three hours to Detroit and three hours back in the same night), and the band played only a little more than an hour. BOO! The encore was only one song! For $30 a ticket ($36, with the fee those thieves Ticketmaster charges), you would expect a longer show. Whats up with THAT??? Also -- when are you guys coming to Cleveland? You skipped over us during the last tour, too.<br><br></td>

		<td valign="TOP" colspan="3"><font face="AG Book Rounded Bold, Helvetica, Arial" size="2" color="#999999">The Detroit leg of the Jamiroquai tour was one of the best shows D-town has seen all year.  The doors opened at 6:30 and there was still a long line of true fans and newcomers wrapped around the building at 8:30.  While people waited to get in they were greeted by the nickel-dime-penny lady and many other vagrants doing cracked out standup or playing guitars to get enough change to buy their next meal.  I walked up at around 8 and didnt have tickets yet and my friend Charlie and I were planning on trying to buy floor tickets at the door.  As we walked up a scalper asked us if we wanted floor tickets, and then a tall guy approached us and said, Hey you guys, here are some free floor tickets.  You look like a couple of young kids and that is a lot to pay for tickets.  People shouldnt be scalping anyways.  Thank you so much to the guy from MCA Records and 89X for our tickets.  As soon as we got inside we crawled up as close as we could to the stage and when the band came out in a purple mist the crowd went crazy.  As soon as the music started everyone was moving.  The crowd was an absolute melting pot of poeple.  There was a full spectrum of lifestyles and races represented and everyone was feeling it.  As the band played and Jay sang and danced everyone was singing and smiling and enjoying the show.  It was amazing to see how a group could attract so many different types of people to celebrate together.  Jamiroquai played several songs from the new album as well as some older ones.  As the band played favorites like cosmic girl, black capricorn day, and light years people were jumping and moving and dancing and the band was feeding off this energy.  They too were all smiling and it just made Jay dance and sing harder.  One lucky lady got on stage and danced with Jay, and for the rest of the night everyone was begging to get up and have their chance, but Jay insisted that two women in one night just wasnt right.  Just when it seemed the State Theater couldnt take anymore eruptions between the poeple and the music the show ended.  As a few poeple bought tee shirts and headed to their cars the fans begged for more and once again jamiroqaui satisfied them.  At this point my friend and I decided to head out the the buses to get in the fornt of the crowd and get a chance at meeting the band.  About 5 minutes later a huge security guard had his arms around jay and rushed him to the door of the first bus.  He was waving and smiling at us and I ran over to get an autograph.  As soon as Jay started singing things the security guard tried to puch him onto the bus before he got eaten by the fans, but Jay told him, Hold on mate. and took the time to shake our hands and sign our shirts and tickets.  He seem to be very happy with the performance and the crowds approval.  Just as Jay got in the bus about 100 more poeple arrived. Just then the rest of the band came out, but instead of rushing to thier buses like Jays video stardom has forced him into, they stayed and talked to all the fans and hung out outside signing and telling stories.  We learned how termites make instruments in Australia and saw the band members giving change to the nickel-dime-penny lady and her night was perfect like evryone else.  My friend Charlie and I and the rest of the crowd left the concert happier than we could ever be and with plenty of signed memoribilia to hang on our bedroom walls.   gary even gave me his all acces artist pass from the Winter Park Rockfest from July 10th and 11th.  Everyone at the Jamiroquai concert that night wouldnt have been happier anywhere else and Detroit will be waiting very impatiently for jamiroquai to return and bless us once more.  Thanks guys.<br><br></td>
