The original funky Jamiroquai sound was evident throughout and an overall amazing concert which brought tears to my eyes.

Keep it up!!!

After i came out of the SECC I was just as amazed as I was the First time i heard them a few years back at the same venue. I would like to congratulate Nick on doing such a great job (you were thrown in at the deep end and i hope you enjoyed it).  I am a drummer in a band and my bass player and i have idolized the band for a few years now. Their rhythm section is the tightest in the country, the front man is just such a mover with great vocals that just makes the music flow (anyone who can walk the length of the stage on his hands is the man). Wallace just gives it that ambient edge while Mr DJ &amp; Mr Midi just top it all of.  You cant praise the band without mentioning the  Guitarman with some great Jazz chords and the un-sung heros of the brass section who give it that Big Band sound. I dont know if people will agree with me when i say you have to be a fellow musician to fully appreciate how much hard work and determination each member has put in to their instrument. Congratulations to every member of the band for giving all your fans the music that has been missing for a long time.  Keep up the good work and i cant wait to hear what you are going to throw at us next!

<br>
Ive been a fan of the band since 93 and Ive seen them live twice now, both times at the SECC and I thought that the gig in June was excellent.  I went along with a friend who hadnt heard much of Jamiroquais music, but shes now a total convert! Went out the next day and bought Synkronized and everything.  
<br>

<br>
It wasnt just the crowd that seemed to be enjoying themselves either, Nick Fyffe didnt take the smile off his face all the way through the gig which was great to see. 
<br>

<br>
The lighting was amazing and the set one of the most original Ive seen in a long time.  Definite showmanship carried off to a T.  Its also good when a band, or at least the frontman, takes time to interact with the audience, which Jay did with ease.  I can definitely see what Denise sees in him.  Not only does he have the looks and the bank balance, but hes got the moves to go with them!
<br>

<br>
Im dissapointed Jamiroquai arent playing at T in the Park, but I suppose we better let America get a taste of the band as well.
<br>

<br>
Haste ye back - looking forward to it already!<br><br></td>

<br>

<br>
Wow! That was just fantastic!
<br>

<br>
Without a doubt the best live gig Ive ever seen. Sound quality wasnt great, but then the SECC is just a big shed.
<br>

<br>
The lighting was stunning and the band just rock. Theres no doubt that Jamiroquai can cut it live, the best live band in the UK? Very probably...
<br>

<br>
The only downside to the gig was the length of time between Andy Carroll finishing and the band starting.
<br>

<br>
Highlight for me was Deeper Underground - definetely a different monster than the recorded version.
<br>

<br>
We were both so much in awe of this gig that we got engaged about 10 minutes after it finished. And we still havent come down since.
<br>

<br>
Wanna see you back here soon.
<br>

<br>
Take it easy
