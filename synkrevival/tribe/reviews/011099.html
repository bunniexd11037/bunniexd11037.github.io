		<td valign="TOP" colspan="3"><font face="AG Book Rounded Bold, Helvetica, Arial" size="2" color="#999999">When I came home from school on Friday, 1st of October, it was time to drive to Amnéville, where I was going to see my second Jamiroquai gig at the Galaxie.
<br>
There were already a lot of excited people sitting on the floor, rolling some fresh fatties...
<br>
I got a good place, about 5 m away from the stage. And I couldn’t believe my eyes when the lights went off. It was nearly 20:30, and people began to scream. My heart was beating so fast because I thought Jay &amp; Co. would appear on the stage. But first we saw a DJ and two “hip-hop guys”, and it lasted about 45 min. It was a real torture. Nevermind, the best part of the night was ready to come.
<br>
We had to wait patiently another half an hour, listening to dance music, breathing the cannabis smell...
<br>
Then everything went so fast. I saw the entire band getting ready behind their instruments and Jay came from nowhere with a twist. They started with “High Times” which made the whole crew jump and scream. I thought I was going to faint for a moment, like a lot of people already were!
<br>
After playing “Alright” and “ Space Cowboy”, Jay said:” It’s been a long time...Are you ready to enjoy yourselves?”
<br>
-Yeaaaaah!
<br>
Then he drank some French water and said:” You still make the best mineral water!”
<br>
They continued with the very new “Soul Education”. It was better than on the album! After “Cosmic Girl”, while the people where waving their arms, Jay tried to flatter the crew:” That’s France! You’re very good to us, everytime we come here.” Then they did a very nice intro for “Virtual Insanity”.
<br>
Jay had to make one of his speeches:
<br>
“We’re coming to the next thousand years, and hopefully we can live in peace without war. Freedom for everybody! No dictators, no nuclear weapons, no genetically modified food...None of that shit. I don’t want it, we don’t need it!” You’ve guessed they were going to play “Planet Home”. The bass was very heavy and it was so hot! Wallis only featured on one tune,“ Supersonic”. Then came “Travelling without moving” and a girl behind us was having hysterics.
<br>
After this very good tune, Jay asked:” Anybody here fan of the “Rolling Stones?” Not me.
<br>
“Don’t be stupid, you must be a fan of them! Now you must sing with me because you can sing really well (with the unavoidable French accent!)”, followed by the Stones’ “Miss You”. I was really amazed because I liked it!
<br>
“Any Capricorns? Capricorns in the house!” After this energetic tune, they played the funky “Light Years” and they made a longer version of “Canned Heat” which was, for me, the best tune. As an ‘encore’, they did “Deeper Underground” which was a horror, because the sound was
<br>
unfortunately not very good and the bass was so loud I thought the whole Galaxie would crumble. But I must say that they played very good and the ambience was at the top. The light show was also very varied.
<br>
After the concert, my parents were exhausted and I was nearly deaf, but happy.
<br>
When we were driving through our town to get home, something very unexpected happened. We drove along a very snobbish hotel and there were two big tour buses parked in front of it. I didn’t imagine anything with that, but suddenly, somebody that seemed familiar to me climbed out of that bus. I thought it was really time for me to get some sleep, but even my parents recognised Nick Fyffe!! I got an autograph and we talked for about 10 minutes together. I was really impressed by his kindness because he seemed very tired. Later I saw Toby, then Derrick and Martin, Wallis, the manager, Sola , Simon and ......Jay !!!! They all talked to me and were so nice, they gave me autographs and we took photos together. I even got kisses from Toby, Wallis and Nick!!!! And there were no other fans! I still can’t realise what happened. It went too fast!
<br>
They were so simple. It was like chatting with the neighbour!
<br>
I always knew that the Jamiroquai members were one of the nicest people. But now, I’m sure they’re exceptional!!

<br>
I was really happy to see then live in france, as i had the opportunity to see them live in Birmingham (see review), but unfortunatly, i was a little bit diseponted by the band (juste a little little bit), cause the audiance was bettre than in birmigham, and the band agreed with me, but they played 5 songs less then in england, but all the concert long they continued to say that the metz public was incredible, as theyve seen the amaizing song of the rolling stones (i miss you) singed back by the croud 5 mins long!!!
<br>
But the decided to play only 1h30 instead of more than 2H, and after the end they only came back once with only one song. :(
<br>

<br>
Never mind, it was brilliant.
