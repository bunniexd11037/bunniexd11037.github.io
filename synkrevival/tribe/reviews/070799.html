They played all the good oldies, like Space Cowboy, High Times, Travelling w/o Moving, and Too Young to Die, plus some new songs, like Planet Home and Supersonic.   The light system at the Greek was awesome, but the piece de resistance was the gigantic, beautiful, crystalline disco ball when they played Canned Heat at the end of the concert.  It shone mesmerizing colors all over everyone, and it embodied the true beauty and elegance that is Disco. Nothing short of spectacular!  Hey JK and cats - Please COME BACK!!! <br><br></td>

I saw them live for the first time at the Greek Theatre during their 1999 Synkronized World Tour, and I must say that it was an incredible experience. Jamiroquai music is so different from all other music, I could be in any kind of rut, but once I hear the un-mistakeable skills of Mr. Simon Katz, Toby Smith, Derrick Mckenzie, Wallis Bucannon, DJ D-Zire and the guy with the hat and the tennis shoes; Jayson Kay all of my pain is hidden somewhere behind that beautiful tune. Marijane has quite an amazing effect on me also but...Jamiroquai is truly my interplanetary good vibe zone!<br><br></td>

From the concert at the Hollywood Palladium, when the band did their own funky version of Kool &amp; The Gangs Hollywood Swinging, I knew there was no way I could let this band come to L.A. without seeing them!

I truly cannot get enough of Jamiroquai. There CDs are virually worn out from playing too much. I hope they dont stop making their own stlye of music!

They should make a live album with that track in that form on it. I really wanted to see them do Falling ,though, as it was my theme for my poster and one of my favorite songs.

I was dancing from when the lights went down to when they came back on again--truly a treat of a show as anyone else who was there will attest.
<br>

<br>
I personally feel that JKs performance was extra lively and that his spirits were (pardon the pun) extra high because of the beauteous, natural surroundings of the Greek theater. The open-air auditorium, in my opinion, provoked an enhanced feeling of community and shared good vibes between the band and the fans.
<br>

<br>
I waited to hear the precious Butterfly, a beautiful slow jam from the new cd, but alas, I sensed from the start that this concert was going to be nothing but a continuous flow of tight grooves. 
<br>

<br>
Out of all of the performances, my personal favorites were Alright, Travelling Without Moving, Space Cowboy, Too Young To Die, Soul Education, High Times, and Planet Home.
<br>

<br>
The evenings standout performances were the throbbing Supersonic and a head-banging, knockout rendition of Deeper Underground.
<br>

<br>
A truly choice concert--even better than the last one that I went to in 96 at the Universal. Thanks, Jam, for a memorable good time!<br><br></td>

Wallis was awesome and Toby tore down the place during Deeper Underground.  He had the keyboards so deep that the hair on my arms were standing.  All in all a wicked, wicked show.  <br><br></td>

It was nothing short of a religious experience.  JK is sizzlin, and if the band had played any tighter they would have snapped.  Everything about it was amazing -- the visuals, the sound, the dancing, the jams, the crowd, hell, even the pre- and post-show music.  The only bad thing about it was that it had to end. . . oh well, thanks JK and the boys for the kickin tunes and cosmic love!  See ya at the next show!<br><br></td>

Jason Kay really dug the backlighted trees of Griffith Park.  We all dug him.  He was charismatic and wicked sarcastic and the combination was so much fun.  The percussionist blew us away.  I happened to see the group in concert for the first time in San Francisco in Union Square.  We were there for the weekend and thought wed get a sneak preview.  The sound was terrible, echoes bouncing off downtown buildings.  It was hard for the crowd to get into.  But we had a PARTY in the warm night air in Los Angeles.  One kid had the moves down and was driving everyone crazy, practically outdancing our favorite lead singer.  At the nights end, we all screamed for a good five minutes before we got our encore performance-Canned Heat- the new single from Synkronized.  There was energy like you wouldnt believe in the midst of dancing, jumping, clapping and chanting Hoo-a, hoo-a! ... the famous disco party call.  I hope other fans have the kind of fun we had! Thanks to the guys, who made my birthday a hell of a 25th! It couldnt have been any better.<br><br></td>

I wasnt a fan until seeing him live. My friend had an extra ticket so she offered it to me and I accepted. Thank God I did too! I was in the pit and had a great view. To be honest, I didnt think the concert was gonna be all that good. When the band came on stage, I knew I was soo wrong. I love almost every song they performed!The best part was when I got to meet him afterwards. Jay Kay was looking at me a couple of times and my heart practically melt with every glance, haha.  We got backstage passes from this really stellar guy. We got autographs and chatted with Jay Kay for a couple of minutes. He even gave me a kiss. He is such a sweetie. I just love him, but not as much as Taylor Hanson, Erik von Detten, Jeff Timmons, Scott Moffatt or Dave Moffatt. Thanks for reading! <br><br></td>

		<td valign="TOP" colspan="3"><font face="AG Book Rounded Bold, Helvetica, Arial" size="2" color="#999999">The show was quite outstanding and the venue was the best Ive seen them at.  Saw them previously at the Roxy (93), the Hollywood American Legion Hall (95), House of Blues, Hollywood Palladium and Universal Amphitheatre (all 97).  The Greek had the perfect combination of sound, open atmosphere and intimacy.  As a fellow bassist, I think that Nick Fyffe couldnt quite fill Stuarts shoes.  But I think he was able to maintain a good vibe without being too stiff.  I remember Jay asking the crowd if theyd  see them play again if they came back, and everyone screamed approval.  They played LA for the TWM Tour three times n 97, but thats because the album sold big.  This ones not doing as good, so I know that we might not see Jay in LA for a while.  But, it was a swinging affair altogether.  I happen to know of a girl in the second or third row (who shall remain nameless), who held up a banner and screamed FUNKTION! at the 97 Universal show, and actually persuaded JK to play that song as an encore, despite its obscurity here in the U.S.  I know for a fact that she tried it again at the Greek, and Jay replied to her screams by saying, Funktion?....oh, that was last year....<br><br></td>

I could hear every instrament in the band with precision. I really enjoyed that track with the heavy metal twist..what is that anyway? I need to get a hold of that record. The only thing that sucked about the whole show is that they didnt play Butterfly (one of my favorite tracks from the new album)..and they also didnt play their jungle track from Traveling without moving..that is my personal fav :(  but in all the show was BOMB, one of the best live performers ive ever seen..keep up the good work<br><br></td>
