I saw the show in Atlanta and it was constant energy.  I drove from Cincinnati Ohio to go to the show and i can say the 7 hour drive to see that show was more than worth it...i would drive 7 hours every day to be overwhelmed with that much funk and soul!!!  It is not the first time I have driven to Atlanta to see them either...I saw them two years prior...it was also amazing...obvously it moved me so much that I came all the way back to see them the first chance I got. I cant wait until they come back to the states. Maybe this time they will come to Cincinnati...but if they dont I will be back in Atlanta...after all Atlanta is known for its soul!!<br><br></td>

Words cannot express the energy and groove of that show.  There were times where my friends and I could only look at each other.  Jay Kay and the guys represented in the upmost manner.  If you didnt groove, scream and sweat Sunday night, you were dead.  It was phat to death especially Jay blazinup on stage!  I thouroughly enjoyed the Rolling Stone remake and SuperSonic was out of this world!  It was so nice to be in a crowd of all races, ages and backgrounds in PEACE for one common purpose - Jamiroquai.  What/who else in this day and age can do that?<br><br></td>

The concert I saw on Sunday night was a date that I will not forget.  The energy of the crowd was felt almost as soon as the band members came out on stage.  It wa an electric atmosphere that took off as the bass ripped off the first few notes of high times.  After that, the energy of the crowd snowballed.  The band was  fresh and tight as a musical unit as if it was the first night of their tour.  Jays performance was extraordinary as he flowed across the stage like water out of a pitcher.  Also noteworthy was the version of  Miss You performed.  The oft-covered, but never quite duplicated  Stones should be proud of the funky version the boys put on. I was lucky enough to bump into the band mates outside of our hotel after the show- Id also like to add that they are genuinely nice fellows. Great band and great show-I hope to ee you all there in November.<br><br></td>

The boys had the Tabernacle rockin within the first few seconds of the start of the show and didnt let it stop till the end of it.

I just came back from the Atlanta gig in Georgia, USA after flying from Dallas, Texas, USA.  When I got in line they said the concert just sold out.  So my sisters friend said I came from Dallas to see my favorite band and which I did.  And we got in, I could not believe it!  Man that concert was the best I have ever seen my whole life.  Besides Jay smoking weed up on the stage but man he was jamming and Deeper Underground had to be the best song performance in the history plus the Miss You cover song from RollingStone.  But hey the album is a must buy and Jamiroquai keeps giving you new and better stuff and they never lose that acid-jazz style becuase of the weed.  Plus I touched Jays hand by slapping it during Deeper Underground while a angry mob were behind me.  I was the best, I am going again if they do not come to Dallas.  Which I hope they do!<br><br></td>

The scene at the Tabernacle was intensely rich with die-hard fans (i.e. own all the albums, know all the words to the songs), one-hit thrill seekers (i.e. virtual insanity), and curious virgins (first time Jamiroquai listeners).  Young and old, black and white, male and female vibed together in perfect harmony as the Fab Brits took the stage and strapped us in for a one booty-shaking, back-braking, no-mistaking fellowship of divine sound.  The energy exuded from Jay and the gang was non-stop from start to finish with the crowd being entranced by the lyrical invasion of mystical melodies and hyped-up head-bopping sounds from the band weve grown to know and love. This show was definitely one to put on the memory list of all-time favorite concerts.  From the screams, yells, and buckets of sweat coming from the sold-out crowd at the Tabernacle, one can truly say Jamiroquai has made a definite impact on us Yankees.  With people driving from Missouri, South Carolina, and Florida just to see our favs transpire their ethereal magic upon us, Jamis popularity is definitely growing by leaps and bounds.  Hopefully with the release of their fourth album and their continued touring, the rest of the population of music lovers unhip to the majesty that we know as JAMIROQUAI, will get on board the Buffalo Man express and taste the filling feeling of the Space Cowboy and his posse.<br><br></td>
