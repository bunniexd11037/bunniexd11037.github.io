The music has no color or can not be classified as pop/rock/alternative or anything else. Anyone that hears them will appreciate the sound.  I LOVE Jay and I cant wait to see them in November. <br><br></td>

Im so glad these cats represent my generation.  My parents claim P-Funk for their generation, but I can gladly say that Jamiroquai is keeping it real with those funky tight grooves that make the soul fly from your body.  The show at the 9:30 club on the 19th of July was amazing.  I would give it an 11 but the score only goes up to 10.  The only problem is that I wanted to give Jay a five.  His hand was inches away from mine.  Ill give him a five at the next show in November.  I would quit my job to see those cats play again.  That show was the highlight of my summer.  Off the hook I tell you.  Man those cats are funky.

I was so psyched, not only was it one of the best shows out of the three that i have seen, but the most memorable yet! i could not believe jason spotted me out to the crowd and picked me to share the limelight with him. i am still floating. it was the best birthday gift i could ever get. i was even more psyched when he performed, especially for me Light years. i have definitely got that Sunshine in my life!  my favorite tune by far is manifest destiny, but i know that song is too deep for everyone to handle, so i will settle for Butterfly which was the best of all.  a true fan till the end. i will meet you again!!!!!!!!

<br>

<br>
From the first song to the encore of Canned Heat Jamiroquai had the audience on their feet dancing and singing.  
<br>

<br>
Only one slight complaint is that they didnt perform any songs from the first album.  Which is cool.  Jay said that they like to do the new stuff.
<br>

<br>
All the hits from Return of the Space Cowboy, Alright, Morning Glory, Butterfly were great to hear live.  
<br>

<br>
Great lighting, audience participation, great music and a great venue(Thanks 9:30 Club!) and one of the hottest bands around added up to one of the hottest shows of the year 
<br>

<br>
Shout out to all the D.C. Jamiroquai fans and a special hello to the Italian guy interning in D.C. who asked for directions to the show.  Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

I loved the performances of SUPERSONIC and PLANET HOME especially, but unfortunately COSMIC GIRL wasnt played for us! Jay is an awesome performer, along with the other amazing musicians. The 9:30 Club is a great venue because its small and the vibe is just great..you feel so close to the band, unlike a huge arena concert for example. Washington misses you guys already!!
