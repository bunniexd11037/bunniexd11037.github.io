<br>
In september I was on my yearly homevisit and had the luck to see that you had a date on the Synchronized tour in Milano. I convinced my boyfriend that we simply have to go there even though it would be a bit complicated as we were on the westcoast. Anyway I have to say that even though having been to concerts of great bands all my life since my teens, this was the experience of my life, perfect set, a stunning Nick Fyffe and J in an amazing form in front of an enthusiastic public. I enjoyed every minute except from the despicable  capricorn day, may I suggest you do the original demo of when you gonna learn instead? Anotehr minus is the official merchandise, pure bullshit in colours and style,please shape up unless you want the pirates taking over that department. Love Enrica.<br><br></td>

I started to love jamiroquai music three years ago and I never think they could be so powerful in a lve act. That night I also had the opportunity to see Wallis playing his didgeridoo, my favorite musical instrument ever!
<br>
Most people was there to hear synkronized songs, but they also remembered travelling without moving tracks and they wouldnt stop singing  i miss you of the rolling stones! Jay played with fans and also talked about Ferrari.(not very lucky this year)  
<br>
I think that now Jay &amp; co. know how Italy and Ferrari fans love their band! Filaforum was grooving and shaking all the time!.

		<td valign="TOP" colspan="3"><font face="AG Book Rounded Bold, Helvetica, Arial" size="2" color="#999999">[Alright - put your hands together.]  The time was 9pm, the place was Milan and it was time for Jamiroquai to rock the Filaforum.  Half way through their 1999 European tour they were ready to show the Italians a good time.
<br>

<br>
As the concert began, with High Times kicking it all off, people were still flooding into the 12,000 capacity venue.
<br>

<br>
The lighting for this concert seemed better than some of the other dates and I think purple was most definitely the favoured colour, as a haze of lights rained on the stage for the intro to Space Cowboy.  
<br>

<br>
[Nice to see you all again.  Thank you for coming...]
<br>

<br>
We all know Jay has a love of cars and in particular the Italian Ferrari.  He was more than happy to say as much with the Ferrari fleece top he was wearing along with white trousers and the Supersonic white feathered hat.  Understandably when he pointed to the Ferrari logo, the crowd went wild.  It wasnt long before the fleece had to come off...but this wouldnt be the last mention of cars that night.
<br>

<br>
As the concert progressed, the sound got tighter and tighter.  A new addition to the European tour is the next single, King For A Day.  Giving Simon Katz and Nick Fyffe a break for the song, the video display went black and white and looked just right for the track.
<br>

<br>
As King... ended it was time to go straight into the classic from the Travelling Without Moving album - Virtual Insanity. (lovely intro)
<br>

<br>
Most people had come to hear tracks from Synkronized and they werent going to be disappointed.  Between tracks Jay said, [As we enter the next 2000 years we need to have a world where money isnt spent on guns and bombs.]  Theres no place like Planet Home.
<br>

<br>
During Planet Home DJ D-Zire was working overtime, scratching and mixing like a true master.  As the song came to an end, the stage was showered in green lighting and it was time for didge-master Wallis Buchanan to take centre stage for Supersonic. As Supersonic entered into a percussion-only section a strobe light covered the stage.  This was the cue for everyone but Sola and Derrick to jump up and down.  The crowd followed suit and Milano had awoken.
<br>

<br>
Back to cars and Jay had a large Ferrari flag thrown at him.  He tied it around his neck so that it looked like a cape and this signaled that it was time for the Speed Freaks to come out for Travelling Without Moving.  After a while, the flag found a permanent place on stage, hung over the front of Solas instruments.
<br>

<br>
Jay and Toby, probably the most energetic members of the band, then invited the crowd to cheer along to the track.
<br>

<br>
[Are you ready to sing Milano.  Dont tell me you cant sing because youre very famous for singing in Milan.]  Time for a cover and this time it was Miss You by the Rolling Stones.  First heard in the UK in June this track has made it onto every set list this Summer.  Like a classical music conductor Jay got the crowd to sing along to the track.  However, unlike some of the other European dates the crowd wouldnt stop singing once the music ended.  Toby and Derrick led the band in joining back in for an impromptu encore of the song.
<br>

<br>
It was then time for the usual introduction of the band members.  Following the encore after Miss You, Toby decided to lay down a techno-style beat that caught Jay off guard.  This was certainly a surprise for Jay and he truly looked shocked.  Still - he urged Toby to play it again - and had a little boogie to it!
<br>

<br>
Black Capricorn Day followed, this time with Sola giving a vocal introduction to the track.  On some of the other dates, Light Years was the next track, but in Milan this was not to be the case.  It was straight into Canned Heat - a track that got everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY, dancing.
<br>

<br>
[Everybody jump]
<br>

<br>
Anyone who has been to a Jamiroquai concert this year will undoubtedly remember the amazing performance that the band do of Deeper Underground.  Milan was to be no exception to this and they brought the house down in a fantastic encore.  The bass was just incredible and everyone was going crazy.  Amazing stuff.
