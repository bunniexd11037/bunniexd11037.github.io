I have all of their albums, and have played them so often Ive practically worn them out.  The show was full of good grooves and sweet vibes.  The music was loud and it penetrated the audience bonding everyone together.  The music was phenominal.  There was one song in which the band got out of sync.  It did not matter to us because it just showed how human Jason is.  It was such a performance.  Everyone looked and felt so happy to be up there making music.  The bassist was smiling a big cheesy grin throughout the whole show.  The only bad thing I could say is that we (the croud) we getting so worked up and the show did not start until 9pm.  I had been standing for more than 3 hours by the time the band started.  But it was worth it, and I cant wait to do it again.  Jay said that hed see us (New York) again in November.  I havent been able to find out when or where Jamiroquai is playing.  If you know please tell me.  I want to be in the front row!  Thanks to everyone in the band for filling my head with music that I love.  Hats off to you all (except Jay, you can keep yours on!)<br><br></td>

<br>

<br>
This show featured great music, a wild crowd, and an intimate venue.
<br>

<br>
Biggest surprises:
<br>
-- No tunes from the fantastic first album.
<br>

<br>
-- Deeper Underground (studio cut not a favorite of mine) was excellent and was certainly a crowd favorite.
<br>

<br>
-- I was a little disappointed that we didnt get more of JKs wicked dancing (always my favorite part of the show).  He was light on the Canned Heat, if you will...
<br>

<br>

<br>
All in all, a superb evening with great energy and a good use of 30 New York dollars.
<br>

<br>
the first time i was alot further away, because i actually had seats. this show was general admission, so when they ripped my ticket and checked my bag, i ran in as fast as i could to get as close as possible. this, of course, was after a good 2 hours of standing outside. 
<br>
one of my major goals was to get this note i had worked on (with a nice little colored in cartoon of jay on it) up on the stage. 
<br>
when i finally got as close as i could get, we waited another good hour or so... wondering if there was even an opening act. (which there wasnt; jami just burst on the scene, finally giving us something to yell about other then our feet hurting.)
<br>
the high points that i can remember are... some time in Black Capricorn Day, jay fell over, saying something about that being the biggest fuck up hes ever did. im still not quite sure if he messed the words, or if he was talking about him falling...
<br>
also, during deeper underground, he picked up a speaker and started to hump it. sigh. (lucky speaker).
<br>
during supersonic, the strobe light was on full blast, and jay was bouncing around as usual, but this was fucking awesome. words really cant describe it... but if youve ever gotten stoned with your friends, and you watch them dancing in from of you with a strobe light... its like a slow motion movie... just awesome.
<br>
i tried to get jay to take my letter, but he never did (i threw it up there, but i donno if he even noticed)... =( he look my friend, graces, Ferrari Book though... and even held it up with a smile. (im not jealous, not at ALL =)
<br>
That guy from frasier was up on the top balconey, and jay greeted him =) that was cool. hes was bouncing to the beat.
<br>
at the end of the night, i got one of jays used water bottles.. corny.. but at least something i could take away from being so close too him.
<br>
such a preformer... i never will get how he can smoke amount of pot he does, sing the way he does, and move the way he does without blacking out
<br>

<br>
MAD PROPS
<br>

<br>
a must see.
<br>
it gets a nine only cause he didnt take my letter ;)

<br>
I have waited for 3plus years and I was not disappointed. The show was just one big party that no one wanted to end.  Time does fly when you are having fun and the boys bought the party. The sound was tight, Jay boogied his ass off and young NICK got busy. The show was too short although they played close to 12-13 songs, I am not sure. There was an opportunity for the band to give us more than what we paid for but for whatever reason they didn’t.   I believe they deserve more air play and larger venues in the US.  I hope this first round through the states helps the push for more Jamiroquai.
<br>

<br>
They covered (not in order)
<br>
Canned Heat- as the encore, 
<br>
Planet Home - very soulful
<br>
Butterfly - better live than expected
<br>
Black Capricorn Day - some difficult as Jay said there was a mistake, we didnt know it
<br>
Supersonic- blew the roof off the joint
<br>
Deeper Underground - bassline is still moving my insides
<br>
Cosmic Girl
<br>
Alright
<br>
Space Cowboy
<br>
Virtual Insanity
<br>
High Times
<br>
Travelling w/o Moving 
<br>
The Stones - Missing You were all hot as Hell
<br>

<br>
But Falling, Destitute Illusion, and more importantly the song I believe really jams WHERE DO WE 
<br>
GO FROM HERE were missing. And for some strange reason I want to say  they played (light years &amp; Mr. moon)  Maybe, it was the Hennessy and Cuban cigar. 
<br>

<br>
 I, like so many others who have reviewed the shows, wished there could have been more from EOPE and ROTSC.
<br>

<br>
I would have given a perfect 10 but they hit the stage 1hour later than expected. More importantly, the show was far less than a 90 minutes set.  THEY COULD HAVE DONE 5 ENCORES IF THEY WANTED NO ONE WOULD HAVE COMPLAINED.
<br>

<br>
JAY said they would return in November, I cant wait

		<td valign="TOP" colspan="3"><font face="AG Book Rounded Bold, Helvetica, Arial" size="2" color="#999999">The show that I saw in fall 95 in NYC was one of the most moving experiences in my short life. Everyone was there to chill and vibe with the music. It was very intimate, even Wallis and Simon were chillin in the crowd pre-show! Much more comfy than the date earlier that summer at the Supper Club (HOT!). And the show set it off, Ive never felt that kind of positive energy at a show in all my lfe(and Ive been to a lot). The next show in Milan in 96 was just a huge mob scene (12,000+ fans). Which brings us to last weeks show in New York, which I was very excited for. The energy and musicianship was as good as ever, but it seemed that this was an event to push the new album more than anything(only 1 song from EOPE &amp; ROTSC!). And seemingly a short set (90 minutes)Perhaps it has a bit to do with becoming the band that sony would like them to be (read:VERY successful).     Nothing wrong with that, but catalog sales count too. The guys did a great job of keeping the energy high and the crowd hyped, my only complaints were the lack of older material and slow stuff(expected) and length of the show. I would no doubt pay to see them again, but I long for the feeling I got at the show in 95. For me, thats the gold standard, but this show was certainly worth the silver.<br><br></td>
