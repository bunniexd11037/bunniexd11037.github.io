When the concert start I was very excited because it was my first concert in my life and when JAMIROQUAI began to play the best music around the world all the people become crazy (including me). I think that it was the better concert I went in my life. I think that the better songs in that magic night were the Rolling Stones cover, Canned Heat, Cosmic Girl, Traveling Without Moving, and Deeper Underground. Something that I like to much that nigth was the form that JK dance, when in some part of the concert one green lighting thing was throw to Nick or Simon (I didnt see because I was in the top of the Auditorio Nacional)and he put in her bass or in his guitar, and when J sing with the fans.
<br>
I would like to much that Jamiroquai return to Mexico city because it is my favourite band. <br><br></td>

This concert is the begining of many stuff in my life, inspiration n all. Check it, Im from Guadalajara, kinda far from D.F. none of my buddies wanted to go so I bought my ticket just for me, reserved a hotel room n a plane ticket just for me, wasted lots of money, got lost in Mexico City, saw the concert, and went back. THE BEST VACATIONS OF MY LIFE!!! Even that it was only 1 day! oh, and best of all, after the last song JK sang(deeper underground), they left Leftfields Check one playing, boy its like the sweetest dessert after the big meal.

This was the first Jamiroquai concert in México , and we really wait for long time to listen to them. Since the first song until the end we sang and danced all the time even when we were on street. It was like having an extasis. We hope Jay and all the other fantastic musicians have enjoyed as we.

Jam is real and the DJ just did it fucking great!!!!!!.

We hope they come back soon.<br><br></td>
