<BR>
(11/Nov.)so much that I decided to go
<BR>
to Nagoya! I left from work earlier 
<BR>
than usual!! Of course, I was excited
<BR>
at the concert in the big Osaka Dome.
<BR>
But in Nagoya, the not-so-big hall 
<BR>
made its atomsphere become as one. It
<BR>
was also really good. Any artist had
<BR>
never driven me to such a feeling to
<BR>
want to go all the way to Nagoya just
<BR>
to see a concert like this time!
<BR>
With no doubt, the best live perormance
<BR>
that Ive ever seen!
<BR>
Thank you very much, JK and the boys, and I really hope you come back to Japan again.
<BR>

<BR>
No one reviewed Nagoya, so I guess it is up to me ( I am just recovering from the aftershow bit )
<BR>
It is rare for a foreign band to come to Nagoya ( Last time the crew came the show was canceled caus all the gear was stuck in snow ). Another rarity was a standing arena ( meaning we could actually dance! ) The crowd found this hard to accept at first, then let it loose. Jay and the guys kept them on a roller coast of a ride for a two hour set that was perfect, the small hall ( 7000+) made it all feel very personal and friendly. The band seemed to react well to this closeness ( I think the set went over about 30 mins as they were having such a good time) and everyone was giving it all, Jay working the band and crowd with his smooth moves and ad-lib vocals ( he seemed lost for words during some of the breaks), Wallis and Toby were busy getting the crowd more and more agitated and wild. When it all stopped, Jay wandered around the stage as if he didnt know what to do next, and the crowd did the same, it was about 30mins before people finally started moving out. All in all I think it will be a long time before Nagoya gets to see a show of this quality again, well at least until Jamiroquai come back again anyways ( Next year? ) So to Jay, Derrick, Toby, Wallis and the rest of you, A big thanks from the Nagoya tribe!<BR><BR></TD>
