<BR>
I say, the gig was perfect. Ive been listenin to Jamiroquai little more then jalf a year, so I should not be a great fan yet, right? 
<BR>
But hey, when JK, Toby, Derrick, Tony, Wallis, D-Zire, Sola and other ones started the groove, it was impossible to stand still. The tracks Planet Home, High Times, Supersonic, and the damn great encore Deeper Underground were just fantastic.
<BR>
 I knew all the tracks very well, because I have all four albums, singles and other stuff, and almost every time when I listen something, its Jamiroquai that I listen. Though, there was something enormously different with the gig than with some Discman. The band enjoyed playin and JK was so canned heat , that there was no chance of some playback-thing.
<BR>
Me and my homeez had so ***king great time at the gig that we would hope that JK and his mates would be droppin by at Finland more often!<BR><BR></TD>

<BR>
I went Helsinki with my brother whos a long-time-fan of Jamiroquai. Well,like I said,the concert was awesome. I was totally convinced about Jamiroquais live performance skills. JayKay is just a great singer and showman!!And the band was working like a dream.Especially the bass blayer!! My favourite tracks at concert were High Times,Planet Home,Supersonic and Deeper Underground(what a version!).But all the songs were working to me. The audience was fantastic,they were jumping up and down and dancing their blues away. And the highpoint of this concert to me was the moment when I waved to Jay and he saw me and waved back!!I was in heaven. So,because of this concert I became a very HUGE fan of Jamiroquai. I love bands latest records Traveling Without Moving and Synkronized and after the concert I havent listened anything else! Thank you,Jamiroquai!I hope we will see you soon again!!!

		<TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="3"><FONT FACE="AG Book Rounded Bold, Helvetica, Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#999999">WoW! Jamiroquai´s concert held in Helsinki was really the Event of the year! Although the day was Sunday, the weather was gray and rainy outside, and most people were about to have an early wakening the next day, the Hartwall Arena was filled with exited, energetic fans of the band waiting the concert to be a mind-blowing jam. And the band didn´t fail their expectations!
<BR>
  As it has been told, Jamiroquai has turned their funky style of music usually played only in clubs into a world-wide success. And after seeing their performance live, I don´t wonder how; the band was superb, their playing was smooth and still very lively. And Jay Kay did show his skills being a fantastic singer with a magnificent voice and excellent technical skills. Not to mention his dancing... Nice! This group can really do great music both in studio and live!
<BR>
  When Jay Kay came back on stage along their last song (played as encore) Deeper Underground and asked the crowd if they were ready to jump, I´m sure no one stood still. And after the lights were turned on there were still many people dancing happily, hoping to see just one more glimpse of the stage (and perhaps the artists) where this fantastic group had just shown their best!

<BR>

<BR>
honestly i havent stopped dancing since sunday. we went to the hartwall arena, where the concert was held, pretty early as we had decided with my soul sister hanna, väinö and markus
<BR>
that we gunna be in the front row dancing thru the show. 
<BR>

<BR>
when they finally let us in the conductors had a real hard time trying to make us walk calmly instead uv running maniacly [and possibly ending 
<BR>
up hurting ourselves or other ppl] to 
<BR>
the first row. as soon as we had said 
<BR>
yeah ok were walking we started running again without even realizing.
<BR>

<BR>
the support act was well chosen, dj slow whos probably the best dj in finland. our feet hurt like hell as we danced thru the act but the aching disappeared totally when the main show begun.
<BR>

<BR>
the lightning and the act in whole was unbelievable. the set was well chosen and the rolling stones piece was definitely the frosting on top uv the whole thing:) 
<BR>

<BR>
ofcourz i have been well aware since so freaking many years that the band is unbelievably good but seeing and hearing them live was another thing. the nigerian percussionist and the didgeridoo, that awesome kickass beat that made us nearly flip and the two keyboard players, jays overwhelming energy.. all that and the brasses and bass lines plus guitars combined with much much more, not forgetting jays speaks and beautiful voice.. a huge experience.
<BR>

<BR>
if you havent seen the show and have a chance to catch the tour, do it, the show gave me so much.
<BR>

<BR>
dancing there in the front row, hair all messy and glitter all over our faces (dont ask more lol), letting the music and the huge energy flow thru us.. HUGE.

The second the  band entered the stage the audience went nuts and partied two hours non-stop. For me, the highlights of the  show were High Times, Supersonic (with the didgeridoo) and Deeper Underground.
<BR>
Jay Kay spent some time wondering Finlands huge success in Formula-1 and the rally world championship, as Mika Häkkinen had won the F1-trophy on the same day. With a McLaren, that is. :)
<BR>
Anyway, it was a great gig. I dont think its possible that The Red Hot Chili Peppers, who appeared in Helsinki on the same weekend, could have done any better. 
<BR>

<BR>
I think that Jamiroquais concert was the best one held in Finland since U2 in 1997. :)<BR><BR></TD>

<BR>

<BR>
Theres no word to describe it. It was by far the best show Ive ever been at. And it really cant get much better than yesterday evening.
<BR>

<BR>
Even I jumped and danced along, and that says more than a thousand words; usually I just stand there and listen to the music and smell the athmosphere, but hardly never have I taken any part of creating it.
<BR>

<BR>
And boy, does JK know how to take his audience! It was very obvious, that he really enjoyed it and was really having a blast on the stage!
<BR>

<BR>
I dont know how those ppl further from the stage saw the gig, as my point of view comes from the front row. It seemed that everyone was having a blast though. And those who werent there, really missed out a lot! As a music journalist/reporter said today in a Finnish newspaper: Those who werent there, missed out the gig of the decade. And I can second that.
<BR>

<BR>
Thank you for an unforgettable evening, Jamiroquai! :)<BR><BR></TD>

The band was absolutely funkin great in the Hartwall arena yesterday, what a way to end the European tour! and the crowd was just great and JK seemed very loosened up, He congratulated the finn Häkkinen for F1 drivers championship and even joked about moving to Finland where people really know their cars...

The evening was over all too soon...

Jay dedicated Travelling Without Moving to Mika Häkkinen and gongratulated Finnish audience because of Mikas win in F1. He said that cause a Finn won both the rallye and the Formula 1 championships, hes considering of moving to Finland.. I guess he was feeling okay during the gig, but the rest of the band seemed to be somewhat too familiar with the program, that it didnt get too excited of anything. They couldve improvised more.. Supersonic functioned more than perfectly! At the end of the concert Jay did naughty things to the loudspeaker (poor thing, loudspeaker was quite small, so we guessed its underaged, haa-haa) and wished us all merry christmas (!!!) and a happy new year! <BR><BR></TD>

Before the actual show there was a video shown and DJ ? played some groovy records to set us in the right mood for Jamiroquai. Me and my friend Aija had seats in the upper part of the hall and at the beginning of the show we tried to get some better places which we had to leave during the first song. So, we ran to our seats which were at the opposite side of the arena and started to jam as intensively as we could. When we arrived to the seats, there was only one girl dancing and jamming around at that part of the hall (all others were sitting, can you believe it). After the first song I stated loudly that is there a gig going on or is this a church or something cause everybodys sitting, and 5 people immediately stood up and started jammin. The gig was great and to me the highlights were Cosmic Girl, Virtual Insanity, Canned Heat ,The Rolling Stones cover and the blasting encore, Deeper Underground. And the percussion solo was great too and Supersonic with that Brasilian instrument. It was also nice that Jay Kay dedicated the song Speed Freaks to Mika Häkkinen (who won the Formula 1 world championship the same day) instead of the usual dedication to Ferrari. As I said, the show was great, and the audience warmed up towards the end so during Deeper Underground almost everybody was jammin and the floor was a pumping ocean of people. My score is 9/10 and it would have been 10/10 if the audience would have been a little more active (this doesnt mean that the audience was not loud, it was very loud)and my friend Aija gives it 10 out of 10. Hopefully Ill see Jamiroquai Live soon again! <BR><BR></TD>
