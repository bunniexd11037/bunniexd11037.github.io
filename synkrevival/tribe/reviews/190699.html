		<td valign="TOP" colspan="3"><font face="AG Book Rounded Bold, Helvetica, Arial" size="2" color="#999999">Oh what a night! Jamiroquai in Wembley Arena..... 
<br>
Got to Wembley nice and early to witness the army of Jamiro-fans that had taken over the town, all geared up and ready to boogie. It was cool to see so many Buffalo Man designs in Burger King! 
<br>

<br>
There was a bit of confusion when queuing up to get in, with no signs stating different entrances for seating or standing tickets, about 200 people (me included) were in the wrong queue! Confusion over, it wasnt long before I was in the foyer.... 
<br>

<br>
And as we got in, Levi promotional postcards were handed out. Theyre include the same one weve seen already and two new ones. Ill scan them for you tomorrow... the October European dates are listed on the back of one the postcards - (venues in France, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Holland, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Holland) 
<br>

<br>
There was a nice selection of tour merchandise available, including t-shirts, fleeces, bags &amp; stickers, all sold in SYNKRONIZED carrier bags. 
<br>

<br>
I just bought a metal Buffalo Man keyring - Ive been meaning to get one of those for ages.... It was labelled up with a Medicine Man label, and the poor lady I bought it off, obviously not a Jamiroquai fan, got totally bewildered when I asked for a metal buffalo man. Oh well - cant win them all! 
<br>

<br>
Once in the actual arena, we were treated to some really cool buffalo man animations on the screens together with a DJ spinning great funked up mixes of classic tunes. (I didnt catch his name) 
<br>

<br>
Everyone was caught by surprise when the first tune (High Times) was played - wed all been standing around for an hour after the DJ stopped. 
<br>

<br>
All of a sudden - the band were on stage... the music was playing and I was going crazy - I have never danced so intense, or sung so loudly in my entire life! 
<br>

<br>
The crowd was great, Jay chucked in a couple of inflatable CANNED HEAT cans for us to play around with and we loved it! 
<br>

<br>
I was lucky to get 4 rows from the front dead centre! I must have stuck out like a sore thumb though, everyone in front of me were only about 5 foot tall, and there was 6 ft 2 me - in a very loud, bright shirt, jumping up and down, waving my arms around and singing the words to practically every song (I hummed along to the rolling stones tribute bit, but apart from that!....) 
<br>

<br>
The music was clear, the bass was spot on, I am amazed at the talents of Nick Ffyfe - his bass playing is incredible, a worthy replacement for the mighty Stu. Toby was great, Wallis was awesome (supersonic live is so cool!), the brass section were on form. D-Zire scratched his way through, Simon Katz funked along, Sola and Derrick were excellent, and Jay - well, what can I say about Jay.... hes just unique - number 1, a true star. 
<br>

<br>
Speaking of number 1, Jay revealed that SYNKRONIZED is now number 1 in the UK album charts -Wicked! 
<br>

<br>
The play list was practically the same as all the other UK gigs (dont ask me any more details, I couldnt tell you - too busy getting down to study the order of the play list) 
<br>

<br>
During the encore (Canned Heat) Jay pulled up a kid of around 12 from the front onto the stage and danced with him for the song. You should have seen the boys face, he was in heaven! He couldnt half move too - copying all Jays moves. 
<br>

<br>
When the concert finally ended, nobody could stop dancing... the dance floor resembled a night club full of people compelled to just carry on dancing. 
<br>

<br>
I finally got dragged outside by my girlfriend (I could have danced all night) bought a Canned Heat poster for 2 (yeah.. only 2 quid!) rung out my soaking shirt, and found the 83 bus stop... 
<br>

<br>
And the party didnt stop there - apologies to everyone on the bus who had to endure me singing Black Capricorn Day with my croaky, Ive been shouting all night voice. 
<br>

<br>
One more thing - at the end, Jay said theyd be back again in FEBRUARY 2000. Cant wait! 
<br>

The one track on the Album that i did find abit disappointing was supersonic. However deeper underground stole the show with nick on the verge of true perfection pull out those funky notes from the synth base. Nice one boys.

The steps are really dangerous at the beginning of the show let alone the end when they were covered in beer and really slippery.  The price of the program was also pretty steep.  £10!!
